# Custom-Blocks

The following blocks are based around Bootstrap 5 components.

That being said, you could change the classes being used inside the data folder to work with the framework of your choice!

These blocks are set up and created using `@wordpress/create-block` and the `dynamic` variant.

## Admin settings

The plugin includes an option to yes or now to using Bootstrap 5.  If you select Bootstrap, it will add the Bootstrap 5 JS/CSS to the admin. You'll notice when you use blocks like `accordion`, it will work in the admin.

This plugin currently add's the css/js to the FE as well, but only for testing purposes.

### Currently includes

- Container
- Row
- Column
- Accordions
- Modals
- Alerts
- Cover Block v2 (lazy loading for images and video backgrounds)
- Alerts
- tabbed panels (horizontal)
  - ready to use, could use admin improvement though
- swiper carousel
  - slide
  - crossfade
  - slide preview
  - still a work in progress but is usable

### Road Map

- Add an option to add the js/css or them individually to the FE of the site.
- More blocks (carousels, alerts, etc)
- ADA enhancements.
- Other frameworks (Tailwind, Material, etc).

#### PR's welcome

Feel free to chime in, we are better together.
